# CS-210
CS-210 Final

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  This project was created for my Computer Science class. The design asked for a program that analyzes a text files compiling all of the produce purchased from a store throughout the day. The program was then supposed to act as a sort of database where the user can look up specific items, look up all, and display a   histogram of the items. The project also accounts for input error on the user side and has an option for terminating the session.

What was the purpose of the project? What did you do particularly well?

  The purpose of this project was to show off all of the skills I have learned over the course of this class. I think there are better practices that could be implemented to make my code more compact but I did the best I knew how to do and it meets all the requirements. I think my strongest point in the assignments was
  that I was able to get the program to read the file containing the data efficiently.

Where could you enhance your code?

  As I mentioned already I feel like I could have implemented better practices to make my code better but seeing as I only have 8 weeks worth of knowledge I wouldn't know where to begin unless pursing more knowledge on my own. I think I could have done better by making more classes though. Mine were pretty basic.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this?

  The worst part about making this code was else and if loops. I know they are super basic but it is tedious and forgetting one thing messes up everything. I spent way longer on this part than I needed to. In fact I had the project in a decent state before working on these loops. I messed up so bad I needed to just
  restart completely... Which is probably not a great thing to do now that I think about it.

Talk about any difficulties and how you solved them. Mention tools, tutorials, or concepts that helped.

  Anytime I had questions like how to get my program to read a txt file and how to export the data I relied on Stack Overflow and Reddit. Thank you online discussion boards and users 12 years ago who also had my same issues!

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable?

  I don't think this project taught me anything I didn't already know but the practical experience was great for hands on learning.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I used comments and I made sure all variables easy to read. I also made sure that my messages were long so that it was easy to identify between the code and the non code.
